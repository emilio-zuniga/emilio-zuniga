## Hello there!

I’m a Computer Science major at The University of Texas at Tyler interested in computer networking, the Rust programming language, and minimizing technical debt through clean code.

I’m seeking to grow my knowledge by reading and writing code here on GitHub. Constructive criticism and suggestions are greatly appreciated!
